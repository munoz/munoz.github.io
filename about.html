        		<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>One of my earliest tech related memories was when my elementary school in San Jose became networked. I was so fascinated by the bundles of cables going around the building and terminating in the computer lab. I spent a lot of time there asking a lot of questions about the internet and computers in general. We eventually got a home computer and though I was still interested in computers in general, my interest in networking waned.
				</p>	
				<p>When I graduated high school, I was accepted to a film program at SFSU but couldn’t afford it, but I eventually ended up at CCSF. I entered the Cisco Networking Academy because being in San Francisco made me want to be part of the tech industry there, but I did not like the idea of programming. I figured I could make an impact by maintaining networks. I took classes there with Sam Bowne. His passion for security nurtured my interest in hacking and motivated me to take more Information Security classes there. I started working for Children’s Hospital Oakland after I graduated which was my first tech job. I had no plans to get a BS since there were no degree programs related to networking in the bay area, but after having a conversation with Sam, he told me to get a degree, so I don’t limit my opportunities for career growth.
				</p>
				<p>I applied to CSUMB since they have an emphasis for Network and Security. Here I learned that I enjoyed programming. I also met people who are also passionate InfoSec after I founded the Information Security club. My progress has been a slower than expected pace since I must balance work and school, but I’ll be completing the program this year and plan to get my MS next.
